# Fergus Android test

Hi, this is my android test. This took me 5 hours last night to do. Sorry I did not implement the pull-down functionality, I spent most of the time messing around with Kotling gnerics and getting the MVP stuff to work. Also I did not have access to sketch (there are probably trial versions), but I got an online tool to parse the file to get the main feel for the design. I was not able to extract any assets and or font information, so the "styling" is not done to spec. However, this should give you a pretty good idea about how I like to write my code.

Also, no gestures were used on the splash page. Just tap to get it to "load".
