# Android Developer Test
This is my solution for Android Developer Test. It is certaily over engineered so that I can show What I am capable of :).
The architecture is based on https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture-Kotlin which use very nice idea of multi-layed architecture with
MVVM and LiveData. since this is written in Kotlin, we can use it's features like coroutines, functional programmings, wierd syntax in mockito.

I was initially using SwipeRefreshLayout for pull to refresh behavior, but decided to use recyclerrefreshlayout to be similar to design spec.

I spent friday night and saturday for development and sunday afternoon to finish unit testing.

When you lunch the application, you will see 'catch' logo only, you need to do pulltorefresh to load the data from server.
